              We have no interest in your personal data. We do not store or pass
              on your data to other systems. Solely to implement the
              functionality of the Workout Companion App the data is processed
              by the following system components.
            </p>
            <h3>Workout Companion App</h3>
            <p>
              In the Workout Companion App you can log your workouts. The data
              is only stored in a Google Spreadsheet in your own Google Drive.
              From the same Spreadsheet data is obtained to display your workout
              progress in the Workout Companion App.
            </p>
            <h3>Google APIs</h3>
            <p>
              When you log in with Google, you will be asked to give our app
              access to the data listed below. We process this data for the
              reasons mentioned.

                Google profile data you have made public and the email address:
                For the purpose of displaying this information in the app for
                your orientation (for example, the email address is required so
                that we can display it to you after you log in. By displaying
                it, you know which account you logged in).
              </li>
              <li>
                Your Google Drive files: For the purpose of selecting a

              In order to present our content correctly and graphically

            <p>
              Your consent is the legal basis for the integration of Google

            <p>
              The use of script libraries or font libraries automatically
              triggers a connection to the operator of the library. It is
              theoretically possible – but currently also unclear whether and to

              data.

              The programming language JavaScript is regularly used to display
